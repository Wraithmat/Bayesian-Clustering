# Gaussian Mixture Model Analysis

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). It includes methods for data generation, Gibbs sampling, Diffusive Gibbs sampling, error estimation, model selection, and Dirichlet Process analysis. 

In order to start exploring the repository, you can check **tutorial.ipynb** and the animations in the `Visualizations` folder.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **tutorial.ipynb**: A comprehensive example demonstrating the usage of the code components.

### Core Scripts
- **data_generation.py**: Generates datasets for GMM analysis.
- **diffusion_gibbs.py**: Implements the Diffusion Gibbs Sampling class, used for:
  - Gibbs Sampling
  - Error estimation
  - Model selection
- **Dirichlet_sampling.py**: Contains the class for analyzing the Dirichlet Process.
- **bilby_sampler.py**: An implementation using the `bilby` library. Note: The use of a NIW prior significantly slows down this method.
- **nested_sampling.py**: An implementation of nested sampling with the rejection scheme and stopping criteria.
- **Sensitivity_analysis.py** and **Bayes_factor.py** contain some code to compute Bayes factors and their errors.
- **gibbs_sampler.py**: a plain and simple implementation of gibbs sampling, used to profile and optimize the functions.

### Directory Overview
- **data/**: Contains generated datasets.
- **logs/**: Metadata from optimization processes, primarily used during development.
- **outdir/**: Stores result visualizations from the `bilby_sampler`.
- **submit/**: Bash scripts for running nested sampling.
- **Visualizations/**: Contains the code for visualizations and sample GIFs.

## üîç Additional Information
- The `diffusion_gibbs.py` and `Dirichlet_sampling.py` modules are designed for flexibility and can be adapted for further applications.
- The `bilby_sampler` gives troubles because of the N
